Devel-Cover-Report-Phabricator

By default, this module generates a phabricator.json file in Devel::Cover's
output directory. This file can then be parsed and used to provide coverage
information as part of a unit test report to a Phabricator server.

Phabricator is a suite of web applications developed at Facebook for conducting
code reviews, task management and much more. For documentation on configuring
code coverage, see
